                            Payments to tutors can happen in multiple ways, depending on tutors' preference. We work with email transfer, cheque, or direct deposit. The payment are made 5-7 business days after tutors have submitted their record of attendance sheet to our Team. See <a href="/terms/tutor-payment-policy">Tutor Payment Policies</a> for details.

                    </div> <div class="content">
                        <p class="transition ">
                            There are multiple ways you can get your students. First, anytime a potential client searches for a tutor based on their subject, grade, and location, if their search matches with your inputs, you will be shown in the results. Second, we suggest that you fill your tutor application with great detail and care. Users tend to generally select tutors that have a complete profile with a valid photo and a clearly written language. Third, be sure to use our Marketing tab in your dashboard for ways to better market your services and increase your chances of obtaining students.

                            Before the start of the first session, no personal contact details must be exchanged with the client. After the session, only phone number can be exchanged and only to be used for emergency circumstances. All communication between the tutor and the client must always take place via our Messaging system.

                    </div> <div class="content">
                        <p class="transition ">
                            It varies. Although we constantly do our best to ensure that majority of our tutors receive students, there are no guarantees. Some tutors can be contacted during the first few weeks upon registration while other tutors not at all. However, we recommend several ways where you can greatly improve your chances of being contacted:<br>
                            <br>
                            I. Create a complete application with a valid profile photo<br>
                            	Be clear on your education, skills, and experiences<br>
                            	Answer the application questions concisely <br>
                            	Submit a background check to become verified on our website <br>
                            <br>
                            II. Market yourself using our 'Marketing' tab as seen in your account dashboard<br>
                            <br>
                            III. Set a reasonable price<br>
                            	Ensure that your price matches with your skills and qualifications<br>
                            	Based on our experience, we recommend a price range of $20-$50 per hour. <br>
                            <br>
                            IV. Receive high ratings and feedback from existing clients

                        <p class="transition ">
                            Yes. You must include a valid photo and a completed profile to be a member of our team. Doing so also allows you to attract more clients and create a more successful tutoring business.
